            <p class="p1" style="background-color:rgb(170, 120, 200);">
                I was born on <strong><em><u>25th July
                            2003</u></em></strong> in <em>Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India.</em></p>



            <p class="p2" style="background-color:rgb(100, 200, 230);">
                So far I've <em>three schools</em>. When I was a kid I
                studied at <b><u>Ahmedabad Pubic School</u></b> where I studied for <em>2 years(1st and 2nd grade)</em>.
                After that, we moved to a different city and because of that, I had to change my school. And for the
                next 5 years, I studied at <b><u>Ganpat University</u></b> which is quite a <i>famous school</i>. I
                studied there for like<em> 5 years(from 3rd to 8th grade)</em>. I studied there till the 8th 1st sem and
                after that, I had to change school cause we were moving again to back to <b>Gandhinagar</b> and there I
                got admission to <b><u>Swaminarayan Dham International School(SDIS)</u></b>. Which was run by the
                <b><em>SMVS</em></b> group. And there I studied till <em>12th grade(8th to 12th Grade)</em> and was
                passed from here. During this whole time I met many teachers and many friends and some of them were so
                nice that we are still in contact even after so many years.
            </p>



            <p class="p3" style="background-color:rgb(170, 120, 200);">
                There are quite a few achievements I've got so far. One of
                them will be that I got a compliment from my head coach that <em>my wicket-keeping skills have improved
                    drastically</em>. This may not be a huge thing but it was for me as <em>I was struggling in
                    wicketkeeping</em>. Let's talk about some <b>real achievements</b> now. I've won <b><u>first prize
                        in the teacher's day in the primary section</u></b>. In this, I played the role of a <em>Science
                    teacher who was my favorite teacher</em> so I decided to play him. I've completed <b><u>years in
                        classical music and have secured first or second position in many singing competitions</u></b>.
                And my biggest achievement would be I that got <b><u>100 subs on YouTube</u></b>. I know this is not a
                big thing but I remember that time when <em>I badly wanted to be a YouTuber and every time I got one sub
                    I used to be so happy</em> but later I had to give up as I was not able to manage my schedule but
                now I regret why I gave up at that time.<em> I still remember how happy I was when I completed the
                    milestone of 100</em>. I hope to achieve more things in the future let's see what I'll obtain.
            </p>




            <!--4. What goals/ambitions do you have?-->


            <p class="p4" style="background-color:rgb(100, 200, 230);">
                I've got many goals but here I'll talk about some important
                ones. The first one is to become an <b>International cricket player</b> and <b>the best wicketkeeper and
                    finisher like MS Dhoni</b>. I wanted to become a cricketer but now it's late or not but I am not
                sure whether I am going in the right direction for it or not. <em>But I am not going to give up without
                    giving my full 100 percent towards it</em>. I follow <b><em><u>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</u></em></b> in
                <b><em>Cricket</em></b> and want to be like him. My second goal would be to be <b>the best
                    programmer/coder</b> in the <b>IT field</b> and become <b>the best businessman</b>. I want to be
                like <b><u><em>Ratan Tata</em></u></b> and <b><u><em>Elon Musk</em></u></b>. I follow them. Apart from
                these, <em>I've got some other goals too like to be the <u><b>best Minecraft player</b></u> or a wannabe
                    <b>YouTuber</b></em>.
